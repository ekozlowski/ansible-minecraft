Ansible Minecraft
=================

Scripts I wrote to setup my Minecraft server(s) for my kiddos so I didn't have to worry about it!

-- Note, this is a work in progress...

Requirements
============

- Ansible (Tested against 1.8.4)
- Vagrant (Tested against 1.7.2)
- VirtualBox (Tested against 4.3.18)
- My "ansible-roles" repo cloned to a 'roles' folder above the Ansible Minecraft folder.  (Working on an Ansible script to go fetch that if it doesn't exist.)

Usage
=====

git clone this repo
cd into the directory
run "vagrant up"
